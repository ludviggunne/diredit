diredit - Manage files with your favorite editor

diredit is a simple program that opens a list of files and allows you to edit
their names with your prefered editor. The editor command is read from EDITOR,
or fall backs to nano. Note that order of files are preserved, so if you
exchange two lines in the temporary file, the corresponding file names will be
exchanged as well. If the number of lines doesn't match the original number of
files, diredit will do nothing. The directory to edit is read from the command
line arguments. If it's omitted, the current working directory is used.
